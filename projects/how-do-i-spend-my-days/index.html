  <p>“How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”</p>
</div><br>

<div class="body-container">
  <p>In 2022, influenced by Annie Dillard’s eloquent quote, I sought a way to keep track of how I spend my life. There were 6 distinct buckets that summed up my life:</p>
</div><br>
<div class = "pointer-container">
  <p><strong>Work</strong> [my full time job]</p>
  <p><strong>Teaching</strong> [my part-time job]</p>
  <p><strong>Creative Practice</strong></p>
  <p><strong>People</strong> [friends, family & social obligations]</p>
  <p><strong>Health</strong> [physical exercise]</p>
  <p><strong>Archiving</strong> [website & <a href = "../../writing.html">writing</a> activities]</p>
</div><br>
<div class="body-container">
  <p>The primary goal was to achieve a balance between days spent in the six buckets. Days, not time; since some buckets (such as working out) require less time than others (my full-time job). At the end of a month (and subsequently my life), could I say that I spent my days well (equally amongst the six buckets)?</p>

</div>

<div class="body-container">
  <p>I started out in August 2022 by sticking a piece of paper on my front door. Each day was divided into 6 cells, with each cell being coloured in at the end of the day if I spent any time in that bucket.</p>

<div class="body-container">
  <p>2022 was so intense that this activity could not be pursued beyond August. However, in 2023, I have decided to pursue this for the entire year. All the raw data is available on Google Sheets and a p5.js sketch is used to visualise it.<br><br>The code is available <a href="https://github.com/arjunmakesthings/how-do-i-spend-my-days/tree/main">here</a>. To have some fun with it, I explored <a href ="https://brm.io/matter-js/">matter.js</a> in this project to treat each day as an active particle.</p>
