    <h2>Thought</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>Inspired by my light painting experiments, I further wondered what tools could be used to paint on a computer screen. Some amount of reading on the internet led me to the <a href = "https://pierdr.github.io/Tramontana-for-Processing/">Tramontana Library</a>, developed by Pierluigi Dalla Rosa.</p>
        <p>The library featured different ways for smartphones to communicate with computers, by sending data to them to act on. Interestingly, each smartphone has a gyroscope which stores rotational data on three axes, as highlighted below in the graphic by MathWorks.</p>

<div class="body-container">
    <p>This became the starting point for me and I wondered whether someone could paint simply by rotating their wrist, while holding a smartphone.</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body-container">
        <p>The outcome was a simple computer program, written on Processing, that allowed people to share the <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Pitch-roll-and-yaw-planes-of-a-smartphone_fig1_265906880">roll, pitch & yaw angles</a> from a smartphone and a simple, circular brush could be controlled with them.</p>
       <p>Since the program was made using Processing, a Java based framework, I cannot embed it onto this website. You can find the code <a href = "https://github.com/arjunmakesthings/phone-draw-tramontana">here</a> and watch a demonstration below.
