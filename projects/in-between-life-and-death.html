        <p>Every final semester student at the Indian Institute of Art & Design is expected to undertake an
            independently driven 16 week long graduation project. This is meant to conclude their 4-year program, by
            resulting in a substantial response to an individually defined design issue of interest.<br><br>During my
            final semester at IIAD, I worked with the Science Gallery Bengaluru as part of their maiden
            Xperimenters cohort to develop public engagement projects for young adults to interface with the sciences.

        <p>One of the main projects during the 6-month long engagement was for each Xperimenter to independently
            conceptualise, plan and execute a public engagement programme for PSYCHE: an online exhibition that explored
            the human mind. This became my graduation project as well.<br><br>By mixing the requirements of the gallery
            (to develop & run a public engagement project) and following an
            end-to-end design process (academic requirement), I developed In Between Life & Death – a web-based game
            that allowed players to progress through A.H. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Human Needs by controlling a digital
            particle that suddenly wakes up with ‘life’. The making of the game, credibility of a theory of human needs
            and the existence (or inexistence) of the grand purpose of life were further discussed in 2 virtual
            workshops with 50+ young adults.</p>

        <p>During the Xperimenters programme, Jahnavi Phalkey broke down the meaning of science for us: one of the many
            socially accepted systems of knowledge based on certain axioms (journal entry <a

            By considering science as simply a means to answer people’s questions, I decided to ask 12 Indian young
            adults what they would like answers to.<br><br>
            A thematic clustering of 72 questions given by these young adults pointed towards a looming existential
            theme: why do we do what we do and what is the point of it all? </p>

        <p>While doing this, I came to realise that human end-goals or ‘purposes’ are primarily subjective, largely
            dependent on a person’s lived experience. However, a more fruitful & objective search would be to answer why
            human beings think about an end-goal after all. This led me to a specific branch in human psychology: human
            motivation, right from A.H Maslow in 1984 to the more recent Max-Neef in 2010.<br><br>Interestingly, my
            research suggested that most human motivation theories after <a
                href="https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Maslow/motivation.htm">A Theory of Human Motivation (A.H. Maslow,
                1984)</a>, were either extensions or refutations of the same. This made Maslow’s Hierarchy of Human
            Needs a pioneering theory in the study of human motivation.</p>

        <p>When I looked at the hierarchy, a certain resemblance to video games could be seen. Pass the conditions of
            one level (or hierarchy) to reach the next one, with the promise of increased rewards, but with more effort
            required to get them each time. I loved that human life could be broken down into such a bare system of
            input (effort) & output (satisfaction), all to reach the last stage: self-actualisation (making the most out
            of one’s creative potential by doing everything that they are most fitted to do).</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>This last hierarchy was the most interesting one of them all because of its inescapability. No breathing
            human can ever truly self actualise, for there is never a limit to creative fulfilment. Yet, Maslow believed
            that human beings live all their lives to try and fulfil the requirements of this hierarchy, which is
            arguably a futile effort.<br><br>My interpretation for this need was that this never be fulfilled and,
            therefore, can be seen as an escapable
            level (or hierarchy). There is nothing that exists beyond it because there is no limit for creative
            fulfilment. One can always do more. This sat well with an ending for my game (as well as for human life),
            people trying to self-actualise but never actually being able to, until death strikes them randomly one day.

            The game had 5 stages for a digital particle to progress through. Players woke up as a digital particle
            (suddenly being given ‘life’) in a dark space. Movement of the particle was controlled through the p5.js
            <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector/lerp">lerp()</a> function. Move the mouse somewhere, and the
            particle slowly moves there.

        <p>The first stage (or level) was physiological needs. This was interpreted as simply regaining the energy that
            the particle expends by breathing & moving. Food was created at different intervals of time, and the
            particle must be moved close to the food source for it to eat the food (much like the real world).</p>

        <p>Next was the stage of safety. Hostile particles flew in from random places at random speeds and a collision
            detection algorithm was used to recognise whether the hero particle successfully steered away from them or
            not. If not, the particle would die.</p>

        <p>If a player made it till this point in the game, they had progressed through the <em>Hierarchy of Human

            shortage of food and the arrival of more hostile particles at this juncture. Once conditions were stable
            again, the hero particle was suddenly zoomed out into the grander universe where other similar particles
            existed. The hero particle now had to connect with the others (make friends) and take care of them
            (fulfilling esteem needs). At this point, the game became an autonomous system (friends moved independently,
            ate food and could also die from starvation).

            the other side. However, at this stage, an algorithm (death) kicks in which has a 70% chance of the particle
