        <p>A lot of graphic design outcomes, for me, remain trapped in a power structure between the designer & the
            viewer – the same 16-point sized paragraph is viewed from a range of distances, resulting in varying
            experiences. Go too far, or too near, and the paragraph will no longer be legible.</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>In a world where experiences are largely becoming responsive – user flows react to user-inputted data,
            websites fit content based on the size of the viewport, and components of buildings react to the way they are being perceived (see <a href="https://resenv.media.mit.edu/">Responsive Environments at the MIT Media Lab</a>), I wondered whether typography on a digital screen could do the same. <br><br>
            While many perceptual factors come into action when attempting to comprehend a piece of a text on a screen,
            I decided to play around first with the simplest one – distance.

        <h2>Logic & Code</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body-container">
        <p>What’s interesting in terms of the logic of the program is that webcams cannot typically sense depth – how
            far has the eye moved from the camera? However, what it <em>can</em> do with the use of <a
                href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/05/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in.html">TensorFlow’s
                PoseNet</a> is to continuously track the position of the eyeball on a 2D plane.</p>

        <p class="caption-p">A snippet from my notebook where I first discovered that distance could be tracked simply
            as the horizontal distance between the pupils.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="body-container">
        <p>The logic used is then simple: the further the eyes go, the smaller the distance between the pupils, and the
            closer the eyes come, the greater the distance between the pupils.<br><br>
            The font-size was, therefore, tied into a relationship with the distance between the two pupils. However, to
            prevent the font-size from constantly changing every frame, I used the concept of breakpoints – go beyond a
            certain threshold and the font size changes.
