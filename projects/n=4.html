    <div class="body-container">
        <p>During the third year of my undergraduate study at IIAD, Nigel Cottier in the UK had published <a
                href="https://letterformvariations.com/book/">Letterform Variations</a>: a
            book that resulted in 19,840 letterforms; all derived from a simple underlying framework.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>What was interesting (to me) about the book was how he viewed letterforms as a set of relationships between
            multiple points on top of a grid. For example, the only difference between the lowercase 'a' and the
            lowercase 'd' in the image below is that the left-most point of the letter 'd' is its bowl, whereas it is
            the terminal for the lowercase 'a'. This minor difference is all that it takes to communicate a distinction
            between a lowercase 'a' and a 'd', when viewing letters from the same framework (or system).</p>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>I wondered what it would be like if a computer program was made aware of these relationships between the
            different points of a letterform, but had the ability to freely move around the points within the
            restrictions of the defined relationships.</p>

        <h2>Programming</h2>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>While exploring the idea, I promptly realised that each latin letterform requires a different number of total
            points. For example, a lowercase 'a' can be made with 3 points whereas it is imppossible to make a lowercase
            'b' with the same number of points.</p>
        <p>Therefore, it became imperative to arrive at a number of the least number of points required to make every
            letter in the latin alphabet. Through some quick sketches of key latin alphabets, I came to the conclusion
            that 4 was the minimum number of points required to draw a letter.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>Since the complexity to process all letterforms at the same time was too much, I decided to prototype a
            version of the idea for a lowercase 'a'.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-img-container">

        <p class="caption-p">Variations of a lowercase 'a' with 4 points; meaning n=4, where n is the number of points.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>The next challenge was to figure out relationships between different points. What characteristics must be
            retained about a lowercase 'a' to stop it from resembling a lowercase 'r'?</p>
        <p>I called these relationships 'rules'.</p>
    </div>
    <br>

        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>When you look at the rules in the image above, it can be observed that everything is a cascade of one master
            point. If point A (the top most point of my letterform) moves to the right by 'x' amount, point B can only
            have the leeway of moving to the right between 'x' and the specified limit because of Rule 4: Point A must
            always be to the left of Point B.</p>
        <p>This can also be seen in the code snippet below.</p>

                    AxFinishPos = (random(350, 650)); //Range of new A position <br>
                    BxFinishPos = random (AxFinishPos, 650); //Range of new B position, with the minimum being the new A position. <br><br>
