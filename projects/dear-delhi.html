        <h2>Context</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>In my 3rd year at IIAD, each student was asked to choose a “path” – an area of communication design that we
            would like to explore in depth. That particular year, I had fallen in love with typography and chose to
            tackle the ISTD 2021 Student Brief. The brief very clearly read:</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="pointer-container">
        <p>What can a typographer do to address the imbalance, to harness, shape and organise words in service of
            breaking barriers? To encourage reflection, respect, and self-awareness between communities?
        <p>
    </div><br>
    <div class="body-container">
        <p>As a starting point, the brief put forward the activist poems of Gil Scott-Heron and the media theories of
            Marshall McLuhan. Over the course of two weeks, I explored racial, sexist, political and religious
            imbalances on a global, national & local scale.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>After two weeks, my mentor prompted me to explore locally rooted issues that continued to exist around us
            without being explicitly discussed. The power of typography could truly be harnessed then. I agreed.<br><br>
            I began exploring the roots of “casual racism” in the city and a huge chunk of it was directed towards
            Northeastern migrants. An ethnographic study done by Duncan McDuie-Ra, titled <a
                href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46mv07">Northeast Migrants in Delhi: Race, Refuge and Retail</a>
            became a pivotal resource in my study. It was shocking to see that Duncan’s findings, first published in
            2012, held true even in 2021. Not a lot had changed for almost 10 years and that became a pressing issue. I
            further explored this context through informal interviews with acquaintances in Munirka & North Campus,
            areas in Delhi infamously known for a high density of Northeastern migrants.</p>

        <p class="caption-p">Findings from Duncan's study, further substantiated by my own enquiry.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>At the same time, I was also exploring typographic forms to get familiar with the medium. I started to draw
            out parallels between the Latin alphabet and the feelings of Northeastern migrants in New Delhi. The idea
            then became about communicating facts through typography and indirectly converting the disturbing truths
            that I had uncovered in my research.</p>
