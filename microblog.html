        Presented work at TinkerLabs and felt a little irritated. Do I desire appreciation? Or is it acceptance? I don't know, but something about my dynamics with the team doesn't click. Maybe I'm difficult to work with, that could be a possible cause.<br>
        I made a rather personal <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/C5Drn2Wy-Mc/">typographic sketch</a> today. Back in college, I was known for making "emo" stuff. I think a lot of people label my work like that, which is sad. After being so fearless about my practice and understanding that there are some people who do like the work that I'm doing, I've realised that I'm not afraid to feel. That's central to my work; you think it's "emo"? Great, no one asked you to follow the work that I'm doing, stay away.<br>
        I also spoke to T today. I can feel that he needs a friend ... but I'm so caught up in my own web that it's impossible for me to be there for him. I wish I could be better, but I'm not. This is all I can offer and I'm glad he chooses to stick around.<br>
        I'll be turning in my laptop for repair tomorrow and, hence, might not be able to update this blog. Until next time :]

        Exhausting day. Been working on such a repetitive task for the past one week at work, it should finally finish tomorrow. I'm so bored in my day-time job, it's extremely difficult to show up each day. Funnily enough, at 24, I wish to take a sabbatical; do my own thing for a while and just take a break. Obviously I can't afford it. I'm really failing to see how my life could improve soon which leads me down a very dark tunnel. I always manage to snap out of it, but how long can I leave the game up to chance? I'm beginning to wonder that this is the best reality that I can achieve, and I can't accept it one bit. I can feel it; the helplessness of it all, slowly bearing down on my shoulders. I anticipate that I might crack soon and I think I want to; shatter into tiny fragments that are impossible to put back.

        Long day. Spent my day deep in TinkerLabs work, fought with S, walked around with N and jammed out on creative-coding with A. It feels nice to have talked to two people today, it had been so long. Having intimate, strong connections is so important for me. I do miss S, but I'm trying my best to keep it all at bay. It's not the future I want anymore.

        Didn't know what to do with my time, so ended up working for most of the day. The night arrives and I realise that the 'long-weekend' has passed by. I think I'm burnt out – burnt out of this city, this house, my relationships, myself, everything. I desperately desire a break and quickly too. I'm growing more certain that I will pick up the first job offer that comes in my email, I don't have the luxury of time to wait for a better one. But I don't know .... I don't know if the new jobs that I interviewed for even excite me that much. I think I just want change. I don't know, I think I just can't seem to accept who I actually am – nothing worthwhile really; an average guy, with average talent, average personality, average everything. And I just don't know how to deal with my mediocrity. I really worked hard, you know? I really, really worked hard and nothing panned out. I also really miss climbing at BoulderBox, I think it was the one thing that helped remotely. I don't know where life is taking me, but it sure is dragging me through the mud.

        Spent my day working on different things. I've realised that having the option to meet someone in-person is important to me, otherwise life becomes boring. I crave connection and conversation, it provides a break from my own head. With S gone, I don't have anyone to go out with and maybe that's important to me. Why am I trying to run away from it?

        Thought about this blog and figured out a way to not let it be a
        misery-filled note at the end of a day. I'm now more actively recording
        key moments in the day, and using this blog to make sense out of it. <br>
        Had my final check-in with a student today. It felt good to see his
        progression. I think I like helping people, and it fits all of my
        buckets – I'm good at it, I have the knowledge to do it and I love doing
        it. P wrote to me today, saying 'that sometimes humans also need to
        hibernate'. I liked her use of words, it's true, I'm hibernating for
        some time.

        I don't feel good. Have had a tiring week but if I don't work, I get
        consumed by my unhappiness. I don't know what to do – what'll make me
        happy, allow me to relax. Nothing, I have nothing.

        Did some complicated local to GitHub stuff for my digital sketchbook.
        Developers are complicated. Anyway, had a nice conversation with I
        today. I think it's certain that I want to move out of my current
        workplace but is the next one going to be better? And more importantly,
        do I want to move back to Delhi again? I contemplate the pros and cons.
        It moves me closer to climbing, that's for sure. I still wish I could
        move to Bangalore, but there aren't a lot of relevant jobs available for
        me there. I think it's time to say goodbye to Mumbai for sure.

        With S gone, it feels like I have more time on my hands. Every evening
        is empty, and I fill it up with 'making' experiments. At the same time,
        the loneliness hits me when I'm idle. I wonder what the perfect life for
        me is – should I be 100% committed to my practice, or 100% committed to
        S? I haven't figured out balance as a viable option, simply because it
        never strikes at an optimum level. When you're not 100% somewhere,
        you're leaving out some percentage somewhere. Don't know yet. Gah, life
        is so tricky.

        Arrived back in Bombay, hectic day. Conversed with Ankur about creative
        coding, realised I don't know what I'm searching for in my own research.
        But I know I'm trying to find something – what is it? I sometimes wonder
        whether I'll ever be at the cutting edge of anything at all.

        Arrived in Bangalore, went to bed and weeped while watching Taare Zameen
        Par. I crave support or companionship, as little as it may be. This
        journey is incredibly lonely. I've been reading Days At The Morisaki
        Bookshop by Satoshi Yagisawa, it seems to slow things down. I wonder

        'Purpose' still eludes me. I wonder about its relationship to desires,
        fulfilment and happiness – answers to which I don't have for myself. I'm
        exhausted of feeling this way and not being able to get myself out of my
        own misery. If there was a door that I could walk through, after which
        I'd be proclaimed dead, I would. But there isn't. And maybe that's the
        cost of life (and death) – one that I am unable to pay. Why is that?
        What's stopping me – what is this stubborn force that keeps me from
        ending it all? Is it my weakness? Is it strength? Is it me, am I still
        not convinced that I am of no good in this world? Gah. Miserable, that's
        what life is at the moment.

        I couldn't get myself to do a lot today. I am reminded of P telling me
        that I shouldn't seek belonging from one source, and that even imagining
        it is an exercise in futility. I'm afraid she might have been right.
        Good point in my life to reflect on my needs (stemming mostly from
        wanting to belong in different capacities) and where all I could go to
        fulfil them.

        Hm. S leaves the city tomorrow morning. That's it – I find myself back
        to being an unnoticeable blur in this city. Things have become very high
        pressure and I am unable to keep up with it. Job, life, creative work,
        relationships, expectations, aspirations, dreams. Every moment feels
        like this will be where it explodes but I surprise myself and put a
        band-aid, over & over again. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm
        trying, really trying, to keep myself afloat. I wonder when I'll get the
        strength to surrender myself to the sea. The idea appears peaceful.

        Slowly teaching myself how to make music with SonicPi. I'm facing
        difficulties breathing lately and the inhaler that I was prescribed
        earlier doesn't seem to help. I hate Bombay, I hate what it has done to
        me physically. Once I leave, I'm never moving back here again. I feel
        okay, things are slow. With S moving out tomorrow, I have even more time
        on my hands. Why am I making it sound like her moving is a good thing?
        Is this a new coping mechanism?

        Watched Fairy Folk today. Seeing Abhinay's name on the screen made me
        feel very excited – someone I personally knew had their name on a big
        screen. I thought about his performance at CC Santè while returning, and
        how Varun had said that Abhinay has gotten so further into his art that
        whatever he makes now is so developed. Wondered when I'll reach that
        stage. Will I ever? I feel like I have so much to explore before I can
        even find a niche to focus on. At the moment, I'm interested in
        everything really and I'm not quite good at a lot of them. But that's
        okay – years later, some skills will develop. I made dinner after a
        while today and some music which ended up sounding like an action movie
        backtrack.

        S is moving to Bangalore in six days. It's so sudden. With her gone,
        I'll have no one in this city. I don't know what that will feel like. I
        convince myself that it'll be okay, but I really do not know. I imagine
        it's the same for S. On the work side, I've been experimenting with
        shaders. I think it's a gold mine, but will take a lot of study to
        master. I'm up for it though – the potential sways me in favour.

        Very on-screen day, got a lot done. I take the MIT rejection as an
        enabler – no goal, no place that I want to be but before me is a long,
        solitary road of creative exploration. It takes me where it takes me.

        Almost two years worth of work has today amounted to nothing. I have no
        clue where to go from here and, at the moment, all I am met with is
        rejection. It's as if I had this burning passion, outwardly zeal, that
        has now been crushed, crumpled and thrown away. I feel like dead weight,
        being pulled through the motions of a day. Breathing is cumbersome. I
        don't know how or when this changes. I just am, as invisible as

        Just a very normal day really. MIT rejection should come later tonight.
        Today, I wondered about the possibility of treating one's practice like
        a sacred space – no one takes shit against their religion. Can I build
        such a wall around my practice? Will it also help to treat myself with
        some degree of sanctity, in a way that other people's opinions don't
        penetrate my armour? Or is that too egoistic and self-indulgent? Don't
        know yet.

        Made it an unnecessarily long day. I like evenings where I'm by myself.
        I think I'm starting to prefer my own company over anyone else's, a
        theme that has come up a few times in the past. Will it remain this
        time, or will I succumb to the eventuality of my loneliness?

        Wondered a bit – has design lost its potential in my eyes, how can one
        be creatively inspired if they're always 'in the moment' and whether
        there is a way for me to evaluate my 'need states' to help build a
        better life. Another key realisation is whenever I put my work out for
        others to select or reject, their rejection hurts. But then is work
        supposed to be bubbled? Then why create it for other people? The last
        bit is a curveball.

        Heavily inspired but feebly scared. Attended Nishita's talk centered
        around the creative inner critic. I think I've narrowed down a big
        trigger for my unhappiness – the lack of joy in my daytime job. It's
        tiresome to drag myself to office, work on meaningless projects
        (meaningless for me, may not be for other people), in an office space
        polluted with noise. It is evident that I need a change, and the
        unarrival of change is adding to my agitation.

        Another day has passed. I lie in my bed, wondering about my next step.
        Two years of my life went by in a mad pursuit of experimental work,
        resulting in no new considerable professional avenues. 730+ days of mere
        vanity. I don't know where to go from here. It feels like someone clawed
        their way into my body, ripped out my heart and tossed it away because
        it doesn't belong in the real world. There seems to be nothing
        meaningful that I can offer to the world – no task that someone else
        can't do better, no combination of words that haven't been written
        before, no difference to transform people's lives, no joy to share and
        no presence to give. What am I doing here? Why should I consume the
        Earth's resources when I have nothing to give back? The ledger of my
        life is turning heavier, and I'm running out of ways to pay back the
        debt.

        Each day brings diversely new activities, but my body firmly refuses to

        trapped in two dimensions, unable to enter more.

        Hectic day. Cooked and ate dinner after almost two weeks. I'm supposed
        to give a couple of talks this week, and collating work has been

        I think my personal creative work brings some semblance of meaning in my
        life. I had a bad meltdown, but then found myself lost in work till
        midnight. What am I doing with my life? Does my work even have meaning
        or am I living in a self-gratified bubble? I hope I find a professional
        avenue soon; the lack of it is driving me to spiral.

        people are futile pursuits. It's so much simpler right now – me and my

        still plagued by my unfulfilled professional aspirations but it is
        seeming to pass, the helplessness is beginning to set in. I can only do
        so much. Can I make some music, call it a night and smile? No, smiling
        is still a distant activity. But I like the silence, the peace of being
        alone in my room at midnight, knowing that I'm untethered in this

        There are so many facets of single-adult life. I'm overwhelmed. I have
        no ability to maintain a healthy balance between them, ensuring some
        success in all of them. It is infuriating that life cannot be a
        tunnelled journey into my work; that I have to worry about money,
        health, recreation, balance and all the other human absurdities. The
        pressure of a stable future is really getting to me and my will to exist

        Got accepted into the Fabrica residency today. It felt good, almost
        positively overwhelming after my constant run of rejections. It was a
        big moment, but somehow I didn't have anyone to celebrate it with. Or,
        rather the few people that I wanted to celebrate this small-win with
        weren't there. Still a lot of thinking to do about my future. Met
        Anusheel with S today. He's a passionate guy, with differing views on a
        lot of things because of his experience and inexperience. Let's see if a
        fruitful collaboration works out. Over the last few weeks, I've been
        making incremental progress with work. This is a strong reminder that
        things will work out, eventually, in due time.

        learning matter.js for a data visualisation project that I've thought
        about since October 2022. Things will happen, Arjun; just be patient.
        Patience, that's an old-person word. I don't have any activities in this
        city, apart from work, that can make me happy. I miss climbing, walking,
        going to old bookshops, attending talks. I miss Bangalore. When I was
        applying for the MIT Media Lab, Pratyush said, "their loss if they don't
        take you". I'm starting to disbelieve that statement, I've had so many
        rejections in the past month that the idea of my inflated merit is
        beginning to disappear. I want to keep doing things that make me happy,
        that's my only way out.

        MIT so I think that's a bust. I'm beginning my journey to come to terms

        Did enough. The uncertainty of my future is killing me, since decisions
        are in the hands of other people. Got rejected from a bunch of jobs,
        wondered whether I made a mistake to be unabashedly me or grossly
        underestimated my value. Ashwath once told me that my journey is about
        making peace with mediocrity, a notion that I passionately argued
        against. I'm beginning to wonder that maybe he was right – for the last
        14 years, I've been stuck in the "you-have-potential" trap. I think I'm
        chasing the wrong things, some of the older people in my life were
        probably right. Can I chase intrinsic things? My journey then is to
        uphold the value of intrinsic things, more so than that of extrinsic
        things. Crap, how do I do that now?

        Each day is either filled with fragrant roses or burns to ashes with
        flames from fiery hell. Some days are a reminder for me to not rush into

        time at all. I wish I existed in a cocoon; not letting anyone in and
        interacting only as much as needed. Alas, that is not the case – I'm too

        Got pretty consumed by work today, forgot to eat dinner. I'm angry at my
        house-help, she rarely shows up on time, making my schedule dependent on
        her schedule. I wonder whether her reasons are genuine and every few
        weeks, when I express my concern, she says she's solved the 'problem'.
        I've now grown skeptical – should I trust her or intervene myself and
        try to figure out a solution with her. This makes the incident an
        interesting thought starter – at what point is a person ready to accept
        help, after they've tried their own ways and failed? What stops my
        house-help, is she thinking that I won't be able to empathise with her
        or that I won't be able to come up with something that she hasn't
        already tried? Writing this brings me some clarity – I'm going to probe
        into the problem tomorrow, ask her for the actual problem so that we can
        figure out a way together. Let's see if she trusts me.

        Started working on the premise that was (still is) supposed to be my
        graduate study premise, already anticipating my rejection. I think it's
        my way of preparing for what's about to come and, maybe, I'll be okay by
        the time it does (because I would have already made peace with it). Now
        that my graduate application has been sent out, I feel more at ease, as
        if time isn't running out for me to get where I want to. I think I'll
        make it, somewhere atleast, doing unique things that people recognise me
        for. After my application, my pursuit has been to be slow & present
        – two things that I have rarely been able to be. I enjoy timeless

        Met a lot of people but can't say they were quality conversations. Is it
        nice merely to catch up about trivial things? But what else could I
        expect, considering that I stay away from them most of the time. How
        much can you pack into a couple of hours of meeting? Missed S. Also
        realised that I prefer colder weather. A little bit of fat has started
        to accumulate in my belly and I don't like the way it feels. It makes me
        feel that somewhere I've failed. I'm trying to get back into shape
        though. I keep maniacally checking my email for an update on my MIT
        application. I don't know how I feel about it – do I have the slight
        hope that I'll get an interview or am I excitedly waiting for the
        rejection that will send me into an existential spiral? Sometimes I
        wonder if I like being defeated by tough challenges, a masochistic

        Saw a lot of conversations today on a 2-hour train ride after going to
        drop S. People fighting, resolving, understanding, misunderstanding,
        discussing, planning, joking. So much of life is spent talking to other
        people, exploring their experience of life. It's a rather pretty system,
        everyone goes an ambiguous experience that is so contrastingly different
        from one another that each new perspective is a version of the truth, or
        a permanent temporary truth.

        learning. I've arrived at the conclusion that it has to be a mix between
        structured & unstructured learning, the structured bit being the one to
        crack. I also have to travel to Delhi in 2 days, a reality that I'm not
        quite comfortable with. However, I forced myself to only stay for 2 days

        Wondered about dispassionate people – how do people go about their lives
        without ever being consumed in the pursuit of something? I figure that
        they must be passionate about some thing, just not academic things.
        Then, in that case, why do people admit themselves to institutes devoted
        to learning? Strange, the people who crave learning are outside of
        school while the ones inside are bored of learning.

        Been facilitating workshops over the last 3 days, tomorrow's the last
        one. I've finally figured out a way for reluctant students to put down
        wacky ideas on paper – use authority to give them a task of achieving a
        near impossible number of ideas using a method that displays freeness
        (mind-mapping), in an "amused" state. It has worked well for me once,
        and I'm excited to try it again, this time with a group of even more
        reluctant students. I also heard my coworkers state that I'm
        unbelievably consistent with my personal creative work and I had no
        reason for them – I simply said, I can't sleep otherwise. I feel like a
        manifestation of Charles Bukowski's poem,
        <a href="https://poets.org/poem/so-you-want-be-writer"
          >"So You Want To Be A Writer?"</a

        like the bland-er food I make at home.

        The world has clarity on how they wish this year to go. I feebly have
        questions, hypotheses, experiments and a mess of words that demand
        synthetic ability that I do not possess at the moment.

        is a beginning to my explorations in 2024 – a year that I imagined
        drastically differently, four years ago.

        Woohoo! Finished all the work I had planned for the weekend. No new
        thoughts particularly; I'm struggling with a lot of mosquitos in my
        house. Need to find a good way to keep them out. Also watched "Kho Gaye
        Hum Kahan" – no strong opinions, just an "eh" film. It was well shot but
        the storyline lacked grip. The end was also a little preachy in my
        opinion.

        I find myself with a mountain of work to complete over the weekend. The
        goal is to tactfully get most of it done tomorrow, whilst having a
        little bit of time to unwind and relax. Will this be possible? I don't
        know. Work is starting to seem like an unwanted burden but what else am
        I supposed to do, I desperately need my job. I can only hope to strike a
        better balance, to not let it consume my creative aspirations.

        I feel a little low today and it's not a single reason, but an array of
        them. I've realised that sleeping for longer helps and I plan to get in
        a run tomorrow morning to kick-start my day. I also read up a little bit
        on livecoding and I'm interested in the possibilities that could arise
        by using algorithms to generate music & visuals. Maybe a possible
        learning endeavour for 2024.

        Very thoughtful day. I wondered about why I clash with strong
        personalities – something that has been on my mind for a while now. I
        have two hypotheses – one being that I lack conviction in my own points.
        Maybe my base isn't strong enough; but that can't be true because I
        mentor and guide well enough. And I'm not poorly read. The next possible
        reason is because I'm afraid of defeat, my point versus your point and I
        lose, you win. Is that it? I haven't figured this interaction out yet
        – how do I put forth my thoughts amongst people with strong thoughts who
        aren't willing to budge? I also feel creatively suffocated but I have no
        way out yet. I hope I get to be in a more creative, liberal and
        experimentative space soon. Trying to get sleep & exercise back into my
        life, let's see how long that lasts.

        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109831/">movie</a>; all before
        11PM. I'm hoping to add a little bit of slowness to my life, living the
        moments I otherwise frivolously spend. Today is a day where I find
        myself peacefully smiling, comforted by warmth even amidst the horrible
        Bombay weather. I also got to know about someone who lost their job
        today in a company-wide layoff. It forces me to re-count my blessings,
        and to be more accountable with what I have.

        I'm in Visakhapatnam today, to take a 2-day long workshop at IIM. I feel
        a little rattled about the deck that I'm using tomorrow, only because
        I've made a lot of changes to what it was. I hate not knowing what's
        going to come next as a presenter. I also lost my Garmin watch today, an
        event that hurt badly. That watch was a consistent part of the starkly
        variable last 5 years of my life. It's weird, I can't even picture
        myself as myself from 5 years ago. 18-year-old-me would hate the
        23-year-old-me. Even the 23-year-old-me hates me. I gravely
        underestimated adult life. I wish I was 18 again, wearing my Garmin
        watch and running around on hilly trails into the sunset, chasing a new
        personal record. Maybe that's another thing that has escaped my life
        – chasing physical betterment every day. I would like to start running
        again.

        Tiring day today. A lot happened – had a fun team Christmas lunch,
        submitted my MIT application, cleaned my house afterwards, got rid of
        unused junk, packaged memories that needed preservation, cleaned my
        fridge, played football, packed for my 4-day long work trip tomorrow,
        and asked to take the next week off from work. Whew, time to get some

        Had a difficult time facilitating a workshop today – it's very hard to
        do so with intellectuals. I like students more. This one was exhausting.
        It might also be fatigue, something that I feel has been accumulating
        for some time. Tonight, I'm switching off my computer early. I'm going
        to clean up and read a book in bed. Time to take a little bit of a
        break.

        It feels like I'm going to puke. The application to MIT has been such a
        consuming journey and I've given it disproportionately more, when
        compared to my chances of getting in. This is going to result in a
        glorious, embarrassing defeat and I wonder why I made it a public
        affair. I could have applied and gotten rejected in secret, but now that
        I think about it, it would have been impossible to hide it from the
        people that know already. It really took over my life, I hope it gets a
        good look atleast. I think I have a fair chance if I get to interview
        with them and I desperately hope that's the case. A no-interview
        rejection would be tough to handle.

        Deep work in the first half and mindless hanging out in the second.
        Today, I asked two people why they liked hanging out with other people,
        even though most of the talking done is trivial. They said it makes them
        happy and 'de-stresses' them by providing a different day than usual.
        Strange, I would have rather spent that time alone making something or
        doing anything else really, but alone. Have I just become habituated to
        living like this or do I actually enjoy it? I don't know. I do like
        spending time with S though. But would I want to spend all of my hours
        sharing space with another person? I don't know that yet. I guess we'll
        figure it out when we get to it – people usually find corners of
        solitude where they can just be by themselves, even if they're living
        with another person. That's my best guess at the moment.

        MIT statement & essay drafts today, nervous to see if reviewers find it
        shit. Agh, such a difficult one to crack but I'm sure I'll do it. Just
        wanted to get this over with. I also cleaned my house today, I feel

        Whew. What a day. I've just managed to write down my drafts for the
        graduate applications at MIT. This is now my 25th draft overall. I think
        I realised what I did wrong the last 24 times – I dived into it, but not
        enough. Tonight, my living room walls are covered with post-its and
        there are more mind-maps around me than I remember creating. This was
        the missing piece, I think. I just had to dive deep. I feel happy and
        light.

        Today, I thought about my need to make which takes over almost everyday.
        I've realised that it's not about creating the perfect piece, but about
        making tiny discoveries along the way. For example, recently, I've found
        a way to use WEBGL to generate outputs that seem like shader outputs but
        they're technically not (example here). It took me about 4 days of
        messing around to arrive at a concrete concept, that I can now use
        willingly. I think that's what I enjoy, making up new techniques to add
        to my visual arsenal, that I can employ when the use-case presents
        itself. I've also been thinking about working a little bit with data.
        Let's see how that turns out. I also worked out today, by the way of a
        small experiment that I'm running this month. Let's see how this pants
        out as well. Quite a lot of trying, experimenting – being in touch with
        the researcher that I always have been.

        I did so much, yet I sit here with utter emptiness. My inadequacy for

        Today, I thought about loneliness. Somehow, people believe that
        loneliness is simply a matter of physical absence. It's not. It's about
        this journey that someone is on; or in my case, the journeys that I am
        on. They are so incredibly lonely – doing work that no one understands,
        being fascinated by things that others find mundane, feeling complexity
        where others perceive simplicity, surrounded by air that you've let out.
        It is so incredibly lonely that I wish to separate myself from this
        collection of wool, to be a stray thread floating around in the wind. I
        think I was a mistake, destroying the perfect balance that the world
        could have been in without my tiny presence. It's a mistake, trying to
        think I belong with the other threads. They're a perfect bunch, lovely
        to admire from afar.

        For me, a big part of my journey is to be able to deal with difficult
        situations in healthy ways. Right now, I'm barely able to deal with
        them; let alone do it in ways that don't hurt other people. Decided to
        start graduate writing from scratch, I think I almost forgot how to
        mind-map. Strange, I've been out of practice with something that came so
        naturally to me before.

        that I used to listen to at my grandparent's house. No matter how much I
        deny the existence of the paternal side of my family, the truth is that
        I still hold on to those relationships, even without saying a single
        word to them. I only have 4 playlists on Spotify – one is titled "dad's"
        and the other, that I made today, is titled "dada-dadi ke ghar ke gaane"
        (the songs in my grandparent's house).

        I had a super day today. Facilitated a successful workshop at work that
        I didn't anticipate to be successful, finished my two writing pieces for
        graduate admissions, made a new recipe and cleaned the kitchen after
        having warm food. And it's not even 12:30! I am going to call it a day –
        brush, curl up with a good, easy book and speak with S. I have earned
        this long weekend.

        If something makes me happy during the day, I am able to flow better in
        my work. Gloominess usually leads to forced work, which can be seen in
        the quality of work that comes out at the end. I need to start actively
        choosing happiness somehow.

        Realised that honesty & authenticity are two big values that form who I
        am, professionally. I'm not going to morph my words, work and
        personality just to be accepted into a community. A lot of people in the
        world do that, and they will probably get to better places faster than
        me; but at the cost of their integrity, which is too high a price for me
        to pay. That's all I need to be – honest, with myself and my pursuit of
        graduate studies, a professional community and respect in the industry.
        Time to put my head down and work, without making every rejection the
        center of my life. Every day alive feels like an achievement.

        Difficult day. Everything is crashing down. Hope is dwindling. Not
        feeling great.

        Had fun writing a
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz4OP3eI2qn/?img_index=1"
          >computer program to paint with the body</a
        >. The thought came to me while walking, but I know it is also connected
        to
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G0MzlfMPuM">Levin's work</a>
        that I saw last night. I move from ideas very quickly and right now, I'm
        in a space where I find myself in abundance of them. Everything seems to
        intrigue my wonder ... I don't think it's a bad thing. I'm easily
        excited and impatient. I'm still young.

        Had a good day. Swam, wrote, ate good food, walked, studied and worked
        on my painting algorithm in the night. I've realised that two things
        bring me joy for sure – sports and silent walks in the night. I think I
        need to start surrounding myself with more things that bring me joy. Or
        atleast have a way to do one thing that I feel happy about at the end of
        the day. That is it for me, to feel happy for atleast one thing at the
        end of a day.

        reflect as well. Goodnight.

        I've realised that I probably won't be able to pursue graduate
        education. I'm not good enough to secure appropriate funding. The path
        ahead seems murky to me – I don't know what the best places are for me
        to apply to (for study / work), whether something good will come out of
        my relentless creative pursuit, and whether I'll ever be able to live
        out my days happily. Everything is a big-hot-mess. Ambiguity about the
        future makes me unstable. I will read to calm myself down.

        Today, the "littlies" through the day felt celebratory. I worked,
        smiled, taught, napped, cooked, cleaned, and made; while all I wanted to
        do, since the moment I woke up, was stay in bed. Pat on the back, hug to
        myself and a feeble smile to call it a day. I did okay.

        Not feeling great and, to make matters worse, I don't know what'll make
        me feel great. It's as if I don't know myself at all, biding away time
        in a stranger's body.

        Today, I realised I spend a considerable amount of my income on ordering
        food online. Life just doesn't seem to stabilise. One after the other,
        problems galore. How much longer till I can choose the problems that I
        want to tackle? Made a
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzomP9oy_aC/">self-portrait</a>
        today, it feels like I'm running out of will.

        I feel empty. Again, I did a lot today yet nothing seems to be of value.
        What is value to me? I don't know yet. Ordered and had chole bathure
        today, missed home.

        I was a good boy today. Finished my duties as an adult, a partner, a son
        and a creative practitioner. I also realised that I will not survive in
        a loud environment. I need silence and space.

        Slow day. Life feels like a lull. Made a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfPXirmMLps">film</a> to
        express how I'm feeling. I can't recall what makes me happy anymore. No
        matter how hard I try, all I feel is momentary joy. The little things
        feel too little, and what I seek I do not know. I can't generate
        appreciation. Maybe it's just a bad day , atleast I desperately hope it
        is.

        I just 'was' today, a day came & went by. Nothing monumental achieved or
        lost. Felt at peace. I'm okay.

        Emptiness fills me as I think about the passed day – I haven't done
        anything at all, which is absolutely untrue. I worked, made this website
        public, cooked, ate & cleaned. Yet, it is emptiness that I sit with. The
        lotus in today's mud was reading a silly paperback under sunlight. It
        felt peaceful, relaxing even. My graduate applications are crippled by
        my fear of not being good enough. At the moment, I'm just waiting for
        the deadline to come closer. I think that I may not be ready for a
        competitive graduate program.

        Finished my portfolio down to the last detail. Put it up everywhere. I
        realised that I am the kind of person who needs to finish something and
        move on, otherwise it keeps interfering with other work and my attention
        is split. Going to start finishing all the pending stuff, quality or no
        quality, and moving onto other things. Been stuck on one thing (graduate
        applications) for too long. Time to move on.

        Today, I felt restless which manifested in my 17 hour screen time.
        That's insane. I'm scared my laptop will get fried again, which is not a
        new occurrence. I've started getting allergies and migraines. Mumbai
        hasn't been kind to me. I wonder when I'll be able to get out of this
        city, this country, this life. Am I an escapist? Do I sink my feet into
        the sand and take the fight head on or leave in the hope of ease?

        I hate being sick. Stayed in bed for most of the day, S came to take
        care of me, felt like a child. Missed mum a little bit. Tried working
        but just couldn't get myself to. Absolutely unproductive day. Hope I get
        better soon. Restarted my newsletter today, that counts as a small win.

        Fell sick again. I don't even understand my body anymore. I'm weak,
        feverish and frustrated. Whenever I try to get my life back together,
        some absolute bullshit happens. Need to get out of Mumbai.

        Had difficult conversations with mum. S has been there through thick &
        thin, I should honour that relationship more. I haven't worked on the
        application this week and it's unlikely that I'll work on it over the
        weekend also. Surprisingly, I'm not guilty. I've bought myself time and
        the liberty to do it at my own pace. Need to start sleeping on time
        again; every time I fix it, something messes it up again. I'm okay.

        The best part about today was holding a baby. I feel surreally connected
        to babies. Had a topsy-turvy day, felt socially isolated and applied for
        a competition in an expensive attempt to find validation. I predict
        there'll come a time when I'll reject or embrace external validation. At
        the moment, I paddle towards whatever buys me temporary peace. The
        fluctuation isn't healthy for the discovery of my identity. Or can it
        be?

        Did all my tasks today like a diligent boy. Thought about the difference
        it'd make if I lived or died, during lunch. Couldn't arrive at anything.
        Life feels meaningless if you equate it to other people. Gave up some
        sleep to be there for S in the night. Felt a tiny bit proud & selfless.

        Had a good day until the night. Helped a person, spoke to a few people
        and danced in the kitchen. A conversation with P in the night destroyed
        the constructed happiness. I feel under-equipped, short of something –
        the details of which I can't figure out. Why do I feel the need to meet
        people's expectations?
