      <p>
        I grew up all around India, moving with / between my parents, and
        studying in more than 7 different schools. My parents loved being on the
        road and, for the first 15 years of my life, I found myself in the
        backseat of their car far too often.

            Owing to parentally-coerced-road-travel, a significant amount of my childhood was spent peering out of the backseat window, looking at people and visual objects from afar. Perhaps this childhood fascination is what ultimately led me to design, after a failed 14-year-long pursuit of becoming a professional athlete.

          At 18, I managed to get into the Indian Institute of Art & Design, a small (relatively new) college based in New Delhi, scarcely armed with a few fierce practitioners & pedagogs. While I complained, cribbed and sought better environments consistently during my time there, it is now (at 23) that I realise the nurturing effect the small, intimate environment had on me. 
            <br><br>
            I grew up to become an extremely ‘invested’ designer – fascinated by the systems, frameworks and thinking patterns that govern it all. Throughout the course, my ‘disciplinary interest’ kept changing but what remained consistent was my love & aptitude for creative-problem solving.

    <div class="body-container">
        <p>By the end of my four years there, I became fascinated with the idea of using ‘design’ as the connecting thread between different academic disciplines. This led me to join the <a href = "https://bengaluru.sciencegallery.com/xperimenter-programme">Xperimenters programme</a> at Science Gallery Bengaluru, where I had a blast making <a href = "https://arjunsnotion.notion.site/Arjun-s-Thesis-4a732af0f22542128c1d80a64147557a">things that combined art, design, science and technology.</a> I knew, and still know with utmost certainty, that the work I did as part of that programme is what I want to do with the rest of my life.<br><br>
          At the moment, I live and work out of Bengaluru, India – working with people & organisations to [a] do design research, [b] teach or [c] employ creative-coding to deliver interactive and / or performative experiences largely over the web.
